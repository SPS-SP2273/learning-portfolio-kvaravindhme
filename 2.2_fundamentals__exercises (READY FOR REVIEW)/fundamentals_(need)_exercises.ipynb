    "**What I can remember**:\n",
    "1. print() is a function that outputs information to the console\n",
    "2. \"#\" allows us to add comments to the code for readability & for ease of understanding\n",
    "3. A variable holds a piece of information of a specific type (e.g., a string, integer, etc)\n",
    "4. if/ else statements can be used as conditionals: i.e., if a specific condition is met, code A is run, else, code B is run\n",
    "5. Packages can be imported into the code; each package comes with specific functions and variables that can be used for specific purposes. These functions and variables may not be avaiable by default on Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What I missed out:*\n",
    "- =/== are used differently in code; \"=\" indicates that an assignment: in \"a = 10\", the value 10 is assigned to the variable a. Note that assignment in this manner is unidirectional (i.e., the value on the right is assigned to the variable on the left). \"==\" is used as a conditional: in \"a == 10\", the code runs to check if a is indeed equal to 10; the output of that section of code is either TRUE or FALSE.\n",
    "- Indentions have significance in Python; they are used to create functional blocks of code for eg in if/ else statement blocks\n",
    "- There are three type of brackets in Python: (), [], {}. \"()\" is used to call functions and in math operations. \"[]\" indicates a list of data. \"{}\" indicates a dictionary, whereby values are assigned to corresponding variables (known as keys): one value matches to one key.\n",
    "- The dot \".\" indicates ownership of a function, variable, or attribute by what precedes the dot. For eg in \"math.sqrt()\", the \"sqrt()\" function belongs to the math module"
